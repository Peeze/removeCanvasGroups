# Remove Canvas Groups
Firefox extension to remove group items from the sidebar in Canvas.

## Info
Created out of frustration by [Peeze](https://github.com/Peeze) on 2 Jan 2021.
Find [Remove Canvas Groups on GitHub](https://github.com/Peeze/removeCanvasGroups).

## Installation
Package extenstion like [so](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/publish/package-your-extension/).
Firefox prevents installation of unsigned extenstions. I do not distribute the
signed package. To get it signed, follow [these instructions](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/publish/submitting-an-add-on/#self-distribution).

## Usage
After installation, go to [Add-ons](about:addons) and enter the group names to
be removed under the module preferences.
